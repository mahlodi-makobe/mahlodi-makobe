# 👋 Hi, I’m Mahlodi Makobe

🧠 A Data Scientist with 6+ years of experience specialising in Predictive Analytics, Machine Learning, and AI. Skilled in Python (Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, Keras), R, SQL, and data visualisation.

💼 Past projects include labour cost prediction, material requirement forecasting, equipment failure modelling, and subcontractor performance analysis using NLP and visual analytics.

🌍 Passionate about ensuring Africa's inclusion in the global data science conversation. I’m committed to improving statistical literacy and infrastructure in under-resourced communities — starting in South Africa.

💬 A multilingual learner improving my proficiency in Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, German, and Latin. I speak English and SePedi fluently, and Afrikaans at an intermediate level.

🏡 Part-time Property Practitioner handling property evaluations, sales, and marketing strategies.

📽️ I create beginner-friendly data science content and tutorials via my project: **Mahlodi Masters AI** — coming soon to YouTube, LinkedIn, and TikTok.

💪 Fitness enthusiast (aka L.T. Barbie) with a background in strength training, rowing, and sports science. I'm bouncing back from Achilles surgery and rebuilding strength with intention.
